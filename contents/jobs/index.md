As an adventurer, Henry has taken on many quests over the years, though most of them were low-level gigs.

As a versatile adventurer, Henry's quests have included:

* Writing news reports
* Writing media scripts
* Writing comic book scripts
* Writing web novels
* Writing homework
  
It seems that Henry's skills are probably writing, and as far as how well he writes ... Anyway, no one has ever told him to his face that he's bad. Whether they've ever said it behind his back, well, he doesn't know.
