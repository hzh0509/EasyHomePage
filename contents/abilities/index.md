Badge: 'Skills'
Title: 'A pure romantic guy'

---

Henry gained quite a few skill points as he continued to upgrade on his adventures.

He has an understanding of what it means to point a skill, though, which leads to his final choice of sub-profession turning out to be this:

* Digital Content Manager
* Literary Creative Constructor
* Visual Narrative Orchestrator
* Magical Cuisine Creator

Is it hard to read? It's okay; it's just stated that way to appear professional.
In short, he is a new media operator, novelist, comic book writer, and cook (although the last bit isn't his real profession).
